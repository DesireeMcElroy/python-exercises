# Loop Basics
# While


# Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
# Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
# Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.

# Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
# Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
# Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.

i = 5

while i <= 15:
    print(i)
    i += 1


# Create a while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.
# Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.
# Create a while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 
# 1,000,000. Output should equal:

i=100
while i >= -10:
    print(i)
    i += -5
# ~~~
i = 2
while i <= 1000000:
    print(i)

# Write a loop that uses print to create the output shown below.

# Write some code that prompts the user for a number, then shows a multiplication 
# table up through 10 for that number.

#    3. Fizzbuzz

# One of the most common interview questions for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test. Developed by Imran Ghory, the test is designed to test basic looping and conditional logic skills.

# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# For the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
