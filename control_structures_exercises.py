# Loop Basics
# While


# Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
# Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
# Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.

# Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
# Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
# Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.

i = 5

while i <= 15:
    print(i)
    i += 1


# Create a while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.
# Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.
# Create a while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 
# 1,000,000. Output should equal:

i=100
while i >= -10:
    print(i)
    i += -5
# ~~~
i = 2
while i <= 1000000:
    print(i)

# Write a loop that uses print to create the output shown below.

# Write some code that prompts the user for a number, then shows a multiplication table up through 10 for that number.

# Prompt the user for an odd number between 1 and 50. Use a loop and a break 
# statement to continue prompting the user if they enter invalid input.

# 1 and 50, except for the number the user entered.
